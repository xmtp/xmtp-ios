## 🔀 Pull requests

PRs are encouraged, but consider starting with a feature request to temperature-check first. If the PR involves a major change to the protocol, the work should be fleshed out as an [XMTP Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/xmtp/XIPs/blob/main/XIPs/xip-0-purpose-process.md) before work begins.

### AI-Generated Contributions Policy

We do not accept pull requests that are generated entirely or primarily by AI/LLM tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude). This includes:

- Automated typo fixes or formatting changes
- Generic code improvements without context
- Mass automated updates or refactoring

Pull requests that appear to be AI-generated without meaningful human oversight will be closed without review. We value human-driven, thoughtful contributions that demonstrate an understanding of the codebase and project goals.

> [!CAUTION]
> To protect project quality and maintain contributor trust, we will restrict access for users who continue to submit AI-generated pull requests.

If you use AI tools to assist your development process, please:

1. Thoroughly review and understand all generated code
2. Provide detailed PR descriptions explaining your changes and reasoning
3. Be prepared to discuss your implementation decisions and how they align with the project goals
